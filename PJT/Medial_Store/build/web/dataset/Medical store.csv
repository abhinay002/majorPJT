This immediately made a huge difference in my skin and within 2 weeks I noticed a reduction in breakouts. I used to break out a lot during my monthly cycle and now I get maybe 1 pimple a month. I also started using a Clarisonic brush to cleanse my skin better.  You have to be patient with this medication as not everyone reacts the same to the same dosage.

After a visit to my gynecologist, I walked away with a prescription for 500 mg of valacyclovir to be taken daily. One week later I had an outbreak similar to my first, except now my buttocks and thighs were included. I had a 1 inch lesion on my inner  buttocks and my vagina was swollen and weeping (the itching was unlike anything I ve ever experienced). I stopped the valacyclovir after about 20 days.

If you actually wanna be a happy person without being high, this is it. 50 mg am- optional second until next day. Forget the critics. I would say this is like adderal, without the hunger side effects, lack of sleep, personality disorder, grumpyness, depression, etc etc etc. The best thing about it is the government is only selling it for $4 dollars.

The pain getting it inserted was NOT as bad as I was expecting. It literally just was a cramp that was a smidge more painful than I was use to. Besides that, the insertion was not bad. I cramped/bled for about a month then after that my periods started to slowly lighten up and now 3 years later I basically have no period (which is awesome considering before my IUD I had the worst periods).

My doctor suggested trying wellbutrin instead as it targets different chemicals in the brain. It has made a huge difference for me in dealing with persistent depression.
